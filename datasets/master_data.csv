423,"Big Ol' Thread: The answer to ""How do I cook for a family when one person is vegetarian and the others are not?""","Hi! I'm Quibs, your lovely neighborhood home cook. I made this post to answer a question asked on this subreddit, but decided the answer was long enough to deserve its own post. \[P.S. mods, can we edit this as a team and make this sticky?\]

\[Here's [that other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/dj3hbr/how_do_you_cook_for_a_family_where_1_person_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\]

Let me tell you a story.  
When meat-people (meeple) have their first real vegetarian interaction, it often goes something like:  
""Oh, you don't eat meat? But how can you come up with meals? I don't know how you people can eat salads every day.""

Awful story, right?

I'm a proud 1-year vegetarian (as of two days ago! Hooray!) I've maybe eaten somewhere between 15–30 salads the entire time. Instead, I've eaten stuff like pizza, pasta, nuts, curry, hummus ~~(more like yummmmmmus)~~, some amazing tofu, salsa, cereal, potatoes, rice, beans, chili, and a whole set of meals based off of fake meats and fake cheeses. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, meeple fail to realize that most of the food they eat is vegetarian. Almost every side dish, the stuff you cook your meat in, the snacks you buy from the grocery store, the specialty drinks you like, most of your breakfasts growing up (unless you had bacon money, you filthy fatcats). 

However, our lovely marketing campaigns and old wive's tales passed down through generations have told our grizzly ol' ManlyMen™ that MEAT IS NECESSARY! I NEED MY MEAT! Although most people aren't really like this, there's an underlying vibe, especially in middle-aged to older generations \[in my experience\], that meat is an important part of every meal.   
It's definitely not, though. Realizing that is an important step to making vegetarian meals, and to nutrition in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the ~~meat~~ vegetable of my argument:

When trying to cook for vegetarians (or a mixed group), focus on the **staples**. If you're a mother in the same situation as the other poster, you're cooking for these people every day. Staples are global, things like grains and beans. And rice. And bread. You could feed your family nothing but rice and vegetables 3 meals a day, every day, and they'd be more-or-less fine for about a week (probably longer if their diet is mostly microwave hamburgers as-is). People legitimately do this, with the occasional fish. I wouldn't personally recommend it, but I'm not a nutritionist. (Fun fact, you could [live on potatoes and butter](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/potato-butter-diet/), to a degree).

Try not to worry about maintaining perfect nutritional value when changing your meals to vegetarian. Having a bit too many carbs is fine, or too much protein, or too much whatever, in moderation. Try to worry about getting your family used to the change in food first.

After you've figured out your favorite **staple**, move on to the **basics of nutrition**. This step is optional. Stuff like steamed veggie stir-fry, salsa on the side (nutrients! honest!), incorporating nuts and beans, etc. Get creative, and remember that simple ingredients can be easily made very interesting with a little spice and heat. In other words, change those steamed frozen veggies to a cayenne-cinnamon stir fry. Honey glazed? Yes please!

After the **staple** and the **basics of nutrition**, focus on the sides and **stuff that you're used to**. I like to be a little heavy-handed on the cheese here, but if you're cooking for a vegan this is where you gotta up your cooking skills and get those delicious nut mixes and *oh-my-yes-please*\-smoothies. Pro-tip: peanut butter and sunflower seeds. Your ""**stuff that you're used to**"" might be mac-and-cheese, mashed potatoes (with meatless gravy, please!), side o' beans, or like, I don't know what you and your family are into. Use some spice. Get some ideas from other places. Rice congee, fry up some edamame, make something spicy, I don't care. Get into it, and try to stay away from anything that your brain registers as ""hard work"", otherwise you won't want to do it. If you fail, just make everything into a stir-fry. Soy, honey, vinegar, spice. Fixes most mess-ups, if you like that flavor profile.

Ok. You have everything you need so far, but we're still worried about one thing. Well, I'm not. I'd be fine with just the above most of the time. But as a vegetarian, **staples+basics+stuffYou'reUsedTo** is pretty boring after a while, and kinda depressing.

So, it brings us to what meeple call ""**the protein**"". ~~Take it from me, that subconscious meat-requirement is hard wrought in that term. Calling it ""~~**~~the protein~~**~~"" in this context is often referring to the supposed lack thereof \[in vegetarian diets\], and is therefore just rude.~~ Here we have what people think of as protein (and is protein oftentimes), but is really what makes you full in a meal. From a nutritional point-of-view, you probably should eat some protein, but in this context, **the protein** refers to the thing that makes a meal satisfying and mitigates your hunger. Stuff like meat, tofu (and seitan and tempeh, other meat substitutes), thick starches (think sweet potatoes), 'shrooms, and nuts and such. This section is the last section in this because, from a mixed-group meal-making perspective, it should be the last thing you think about. Something I'd like to restate here is that **too many people focus their meals on the ""centerpiece""/protein, making the rest of the meal a bunch of half-baked (pun intended), boring, bland sides that might as well not be a part of the meal**. 

The order above is the order you should think about it, and even the order you should think about cooking it in, at first.

**STAPLES**

**BASICS OF NUTRITION** (optional)

**STUFF YOU**\[and your family\]**'RE USED TO**

**""PROTEIN""**

The reason to think is this order is because if you make the first three well, you can grill up some chicken or some tofu and throw it in, and the entire meal will still be delicious. You can't say it'd be the same the other way around. 

When you get used to this, obviously, you'll be a lot better at planning ahead. 

Remember to start off with things you recognize as easy. Some [sites and recipes](https://chooseveg.com/blog/7-protein-packed-vegan-dinners-thatll-fill-you-up/) can be tempting, but are you really going to put in five+ hours every day just so you can have ""quinoa balls with spiralized zucchini""?

&amp;#x200B;

The inspiration post also mentioned her husband still hungry after eating a vegetarian meal. Here's my take:

I've been vegetarian for a year now and for a few months I didn't have a kitchen, so 70–90% of my meals each week would be rice, beans, cheese, and tortillas (from taco bell). **I was hungry**. The problem at first will be solved by just eating more. A few weeks going into a vegetarian or mostly vegetarian diet can be difficult for some people, and that feeling of hunger is often either one of two things. **(1)** The placebo effect, or **(2)** the nutritional balance just isn't quite there, and the gloriously overworked chef is doing their best but still needs some time to perfect their meals. Solve this problem by making more of whatever you can make delicious, so the eaters eat more. After the first few weeks, though, the body will be giving more accurate responses to the diet and that's when it's time to check out articles like [this](http://physiqonomics.com/fat-loss/) (child-friendly version [here](http://physiqonomics.com/the-best-fat-loss-article-child-friendly-version/)) and then aim for a certain amount of protein/carb/sugar/etc. in the meals. You know, do your best. Plus, with this method you can always throw some meat in at the end, no problem. Please use different cookware, though, if your eaters don't want meat cross-contamination!

&amp;#x200B;

It may not feel like it, but reading this has made a huge difference already.

Below I've got some recipes and some foods that might not register as vegetarian the first time around. I put an asterisk\* near foods that are sometimes handled with cookware used for meat. For example, pizza\* is often put in the oven with one giant wooden spatula for everything, and sometimes the cheese pizza is cut with the same cutter as the meat pizza, without cleaning in between! This doesn't matter to all vegetarians, though. Always ask if you can. Obviously, in your own kitchen, it's vegetarian if you make it vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!",15,"Big Ol' Thread: The answer to ""How do I cook for a family when one person is vegetarian and the others are not?"" Hi! I'm Quibs, your lovely neighborhood home cook. I made this post to answer a question asked on this subreddit, but decided the answer was long enough to deserve its own post. \[P.S. mods, can we edit this as a team and make this sticky?\]

\[Here's [that other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/dj3hbr/how_do_you_cook_for_a_family_where_1_person_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\]

Let me tell you a story.  
When meat-people (meeple) have their first real vegetarian interaction, it often goes something like:  
""Oh, you don't eat meat? But how can you come up with meals? I don't know how you people can eat salads every day.""

Awful story, right?

I'm a proud 1-year vegetarian (as of two days ago! Hooray!) I've maybe eaten somewhere between 15–30 salads the entire time. Instead, I've eaten stuff like pizza, pasta, nuts, curry, hummus ~~(more like yummmmmmus)~~, some amazing tofu, salsa, cereal, potatoes, rice, beans, chili, and a whole set of meals based off of fake meats and fake cheeses. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, meeple fail to realize that most of the food they eat is vegetarian. Almost every side dish, the stuff you cook your meat in, the snacks you buy from the grocery store, the specialty drinks you like, most of your breakfasts growing up (unless you had bacon money, you filthy fatcats). 

However, our lovely marketing campaigns and old wive's tales passed down through generations have told our grizzly ol' ManlyMen™ that MEAT IS NECESSARY! I NEED MY MEAT! Although most people aren't really like this, there's an underlying vibe, especially in middle-aged to older generations \[in my experience\], that meat is an important part of every meal.   
It's definitely not, though. Realizing that is an important step to making vegetarian meals, and to nutrition in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the ~~meat~~ vegetable of my argument:

When trying to cook for vegetarians (or a mixed group), focus on the **staples**. If you're a mother in the same situation as the other poster, you're cooking for these people every day. Staples are global, things like grains and beans. And rice. And bread. You could feed your family nothing but rice and vegetables 3 meals a day, every day, and they'd be more-or-less fine for about a week (probably longer if their diet is mostly microwave hamburgers as-is). People legitimately do this, with the occasional fish. I wouldn't personally recommend it, but I'm not a nutritionist. (Fun fact, you could [live on potatoes and butter](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/potato-butter-diet/), to a degree).

Try not to worry about maintaining perfect nutritional value when changing your meals to vegetarian. Having a bit too many carbs is fine, or too much protein, or too much whatever, in moderation. Try to worry about getting your family used to the change in food first.

After you've figured out your favorite **staple**, move on to the **basics of nutrition**. This step is optional. Stuff like steamed veggie stir-fry, salsa on the side (nutrients! honest!), incorporating nuts and beans, etc. Get creative, and remember that simple ingredients can be easily made very interesting with a little spice and heat. In other words, change those steamed frozen veggies to a cayenne-cinnamon stir fry. Honey glazed? Yes please!

After the **staple** and the **basics of nutrition**, focus on the sides and **stuff that you're used to**. I like to be a little heavy-handed on the cheese here, but if you're cooking for a vegan this is where you gotta up your cooking skills and get those delicious nut mixes and *oh-my-yes-please*\-smoothies. Pro-tip: peanut butter and sunflower seeds. Your ""**stuff that you're used to**"" might be mac-and-cheese, mashed potatoes (with meatless gravy, please!), side o' beans, or like, I don't know what you and your family are into. Use some spice. Get some ideas from other places. Rice congee, fry up some edamame, make something spicy, I don't care. Get into it, and try to stay away from anything that your brain registers as ""hard work"", otherwise you won't want to do it. If you fail, just make everything into a stir-fry. Soy, honey, vinegar, spice. Fixes most mess-ups, if you like that flavor profile.

Ok. You have everything you need so far, but we're still worried about one thing. Well, I'm not. I'd be fine with just the above most of the time. But as a vegetarian, **staples+basics+stuffYou'reUsedTo** is pretty boring after a while, and kinda depressing.

So, it brings us to what meeple call ""**the protein**"". ~~Take it from me, that subconscious meat-requirement is hard wrought in that term. Calling it ""~~**~~the protein~~**~~"" in this context is often referring to the supposed lack thereof \[in vegetarian diets\], and is therefore just rude.~~ Here we have what people think of as protein (and is protein oftentimes), but is really what makes you full in a meal. From a nutritional point-of-view, you probably should eat some protein, but in this context, **the protein** refers to the thing that makes a meal satisfying and mitigates your hunger. Stuff like meat, tofu (and seitan and tempeh, other meat substitutes), thick starches (think sweet potatoes), 'shrooms, and nuts and such. This section is the last section in this because, from a mixed-group meal-making perspective, it should be the last thing you think about. Something I'd like to restate here is that **too many people focus their meals on the ""centerpiece""/protein, making the rest of the meal a bunch of half-baked (pun intended), boring, bland sides that might as well not be a part of the meal**. 

The order above is the order you should think about it, and even the order you should think about cooking it in, at first.

**STAPLES**

**BASICS OF NUTRITION** (optional)

**STUFF YOU**\[and your family\]**'RE USED TO**

**""PROTEIN""**

The reason to think is this order is because if you make the first three well, you can grill up some chicken or some tofu and throw it in, and the entire meal will still be delicious. You can't say it'd be the same the other way around. 

When you get used to this, obviously, you'll be a lot better at planning ahead. 

Remember to start off with things you recognize as easy. Some [sites and recipes](https://chooseveg.com/blog/7-protein-packed-vegan-dinners-thatll-fill-you-up/) can be tempting, but are you really going to put in five+ hours every day just so you can have ""quinoa balls with spiralized zucchini""?

&amp;#x200B;

The inspiration post also mentioned her husband still hungry after eating a vegetarian meal. Here's my take:

I've been vegetarian for a year now and for a few months I didn't have a kitchen, so 70–90% of my meals each week would be rice, beans, cheese, and tortillas (from taco bell). **I was hungry**. The problem at first will be solved by just eating more. A few weeks going into a vegetarian or mostly vegetarian diet can be difficult for some people, and that feeling of hunger is often either one of two things. **(1)** The placebo effect, or **(2)** the nutritional balance just isn't quite there, and the gloriously overworked chef is doing their best but still needs some time to perfect their meals. Solve this problem by making more of whatever you can make delicious, so the eaters eat more. After the first few weeks, though, the body will be giving more accurate responses to the diet and that's when it's time to check out articles like [this](http://physiqonomics.com/fat-loss/) (child-friendly version [here](http://physiqonomics.com/the-best-fat-loss-article-child-friendly-version/)) and then aim for a certain amount of protein/carb/sugar/etc. in the meals. You know, do your best. Plus, with this method you can always throw some meat in at the end, no problem. Please use different cookware, though, if your eaters don't want meat cross-contamination!

&amp;#x200B;

It may not feel like it, but reading this has made a huge difference already.

Below I've got some recipes and some foods that might not register as vegetarian the first time around. I put an asterisk\* near foods that are sometimes handled with cookware used for meat. For example, pizza\* is often put in the oven with one giant wooden spatula for everything, and sometimes the cheese pizza is cut with the same cutter as the meat pizza, without cleaning in between! This doesn't matter to all vegetarians, though. Always ask if you can. Obviously, in your own kitchen, it's vegetarian if you make it vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

**These don't have meat!**

* Pizza\*
* Macaroni and Cheese (without bacon)
* Coffee
* Fruit &amp; Vegetables
* Oreos (actually vegan, so honorable mention here)
* Most desserts
* Most breakfast foods
* Pasta
* Most sauces (beware of Asian sauces \[fish\] and Mr. GrizzlyMan's™ Meaty Meat sauce). Also, caesar salad dressing often has anchovies.)
* Tons of soups!
* Whole catalogs of Indian dishes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some examples &amp; recipes \[staples&gt;nutritional&gt;stuff you know&gt;protein\]:**

* Bread &gt; tomatoes, spinach, whatever &gt; tomato soup, cheese &gt; Ha I tricked you it's a delicious super grilled cheese! Put a slice of tofu or chicken in the middle to make an awesome grilled cheese tomato spinach sandwich.
* Bread &gt; Nothing &gt; tomatoes, cheese &gt; nothing. That's pizza, baby. I put this here to remind you to not throw a million vegetables on it just because somebody is vegetarian. PLEASE.
* Lightly melted mushrooms &gt; carrots or asparagus/some long crunchy vegetable &gt; roast potatoes, or just bread the entire mixture &gt; cashews, maybe some seeds.

   * 2 cups chicken broth \[or imitation chicken broth, or vegetable broth\]
   * 1 tomato, chopped
   * Salt &amp; pepper to taste
   * Saute celery, carrot, onion, lentils, garlic and bay leaf in oil, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender but still crisp (about 10 minutes).
   * Add enough water to cover veggies. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes.

424,Brussels Sprouts Hash with fried/baked Eggs,"Hi all, I'd originally posted this with a photo but the photo was rubbish and the mods, quite rightly, locked it! Anyways, now I'd also like to add in that I had mine with roast tatties and some grated cheese on top because why not?!

The original recipe called for chorizo sausage but I got a similar flavour by switching regular chili flakes for chipotle ones and adding some smoked paprika.

Ingredients:
* Large white onion, chopped however you prefer
* 3/4 cloves of garlic, minced or finely chopped
* Roughly 450g Brussels Sprouts, finely shredded
* 1 tbsp of cooking oil, I used sunflower
* 1 teaspoon chipotle chili flakes
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* Optional egg(s)

Method:
* Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the onion, garlic, paprika and chili flakes, fry for 6-8 mins or so
* Add in the sprouts and mix thoroughly then cook for a further 10 mins or until sprouts are softened
* For the eggs, I made two wells in my sprout mix and cracked the eggs into them. Then I covered the frying pan with a lid and let it cook through. ___This takes ages!___ It also means that the bottom of the hash gets _really_ crispy so if you don't like this, maybe just fry the eggs separately and add on top as I wish I had - I actually took them out and finished the cooking off on a separate pan in the end. Alternatively, you could bake it all in the oven and let it all crisp up and cook the eggs at the same time.",1,"Brussels Sprouts Hash with fried/baked Eggs Hi all, I'd originally posted this with a photo but the photo was rubbish and the mods, quite rightly, locked it!

Be a pal to your omnivore friends and promise them cooking just as tasty as meat. And deliver. Take them to an Indian restaraunt and show them . Ask them for one meal to make your point. 

I really think it's make a big difference  

I wana take my friends to an Indian buffet and challenge them ""make your first plate of food vegetarian. And see if you even miss meat. """,0
446,"I’m considering a change to a vegetarian diet to see if I feel more energetic, however I am concerned that there aren’t enough core foods that I enjoy eating","I understand that this would be a difficult diet change for anybody, let alone a fussy eater.

451,Lack of Support from family,"I become a vegetarian because of my very recent pregnancy I would throw up everytime I tried and sometimes the smell would cause it as well. So I consulted my doctors and I made the switch. I found support in YouTubers for ideas and Pinterest and actually had alot of fun and take alot of pride in the meals I was making and how delicious they are. 

My SO was supportive during my pregnancy he just ate out when he wanted meat. My parents at least keep something simple for me at there house like a box Mac n cheese or veg burgers. I even said I'll cook it myself. His family however think vegetarians are a regression, because we only became more intelligent by consuming meat and that's why humans advanced the way they do. When they order everything has meat in it and I'm being told to just pick around it the only thing I could eat that didn't have meat was a tiny bowl of plain rice. 

However now that I am no longer pregnant within the week everyone was pushing me to eat meat again. I did try it but it doesn't taste good anymore and upset my stomach soo much. I keep being told to power through the pain so I can eat it again. I'm feeling so much pressure from every one around me to go back but I am happy being a vagatarian it's something I've wanted to be since I was little but didn't have the proper knowledge on how do it in a healthy way.

453,How did you transition away from meats?,"Hi everyone.

I feel like I’ve finally arrived. It’s been long overdue for me to eliminate meat from my diet, but I’ve no idea nowhere to start.  With the climate crisis and ultimately the inhumane treatment of animals bred for meat, I’m pushing myself to make the moral decision and leave meat behind. There’s just a few barriers:

- My partner is not veg and has told me she has no intention at this time of switching with me. We eat together basically every day.

- I work really sporadic shift work and have basically no time during the week to meal prep. I want to nourish myself properly. Is it true that supplements are okay to use?


I have not eaten beef in approx. 8 years. I have just recently within the last couple weeks cut out pork entirely. I mostly survive off chicken and fish. I’ve stopped buying chicken from fast food restaurants and anywhere else I know uses growth hormones and that has horrible living conditions for the chicken. I do still eat chicken and fish, I am just nervous about taking this plunge because finding alternatives is intimidating. I love tofu, lentils, beyond meat, etc. I am not asking for alternatives 

My question for you is: how did you do it? Where did you find the motivation? What habits did you change? How was it for you mentally and physically?",12,"How did you transition away from meats? Hi everyone.

455,Urgh...after 28 years I may have messed up.,"So, on Monday I ordered a Chinese one person special, which was Chinese chicken curry, boiled rice and a spring roll but I called (we were getting it delivered) and asked if they'd do that with Chinese vegetable curry (the sauce is vegetarian, I've asked and seen the brand and it is) and a vegetable spring roll, and the woman I spoke to said vegetable curry no chicken spring roll and at the time I didn't question it because I said i was vegetarian and I took what she said to mean vegetable curry with no chicken spring roll so a vegetable spring roll instead, which is what I thought I'd eaten when it arrived. Maybe it's just that I randomly ate kind of large takeaway when I'm out of the habit of eating in the evening (I eat at lunchtime and just have you know humous and corn cakes or similar in the evening, but I've had (omg...) like some serious wind and stomach cramps since eating that, like I mean for two days and I stayed home alone tonight just to try to deal with it in stretchy pants without shame or discomfort and I'm thinking maybe she said vegetable curry with chicken spring roll and I misheard, and the cause of my current foul predicament is actually fowl.

I didn't think there was any chicken in the spring roll, I couldn't discern it but I've worked in takeaways and I know the actual chicken content of those things is pretty token and the seasoning is high enough so they taste of ""spring roll"" rather than whatever's in them and I didn't feel anything meaty when I chewed but I'm thinking after 28 years even a small amount could throw me off.

I feel kind of sullied but I'll get over the accidental chicken, it was a genuine and probably never ascertainable mistake if so, and also mine because I agreed to the order (I've accidentally eaten meat before in a weird tomato and chicken soup that was completely smooth and mis-described as just tomato and I was sick, and also made myself sick in addition to just properly get rid of it to be sure but it's too late for that now), I guess I'm really just asking if anyone else who's been veggie for a significant part of their life (I'm nearly 41 so it's basically 3/4) has experienced anything similar, or has any thoughts on the matter.

462,"Nuts (e.g., almonds, Brazilian) going bad","Hi, 

I find that nuts are a good source of healthy fat. This is useful as I wish to gain weight while on a vegetarian diet. 

I recently began to eat Brazilian nuts which I buy from the bulk food section of the grocery store. I store them in my pantry, and bring them to school and eat during the day as a snack. 

I have noticed however, that some of them taste bad. But it's impossible to tell unless you taste them. 

This past weekend, I had terrible diarrhea after eating a few nuts (although to be fair, I also ate a few digestive biscuits and salty crackers, so it's hard to tell which caused it). The nuts in question were bought less than 2 weeks ago, and I live in Vancouver, not some tropical climate (though I do have my heat on). This is the only diarrhea I have had since I began to eat Brazilian nuts 1-2 months ago. 

Regardless, do you guys think the nuts were already bad at the time I bought them, or did they go bad because of the way I stored them? (should I have put them in the fridge?). 

I do not want to give up eating nuts because they have the nutrients I need. But at the same time, I do not want to eat any bad nuts, and have diarrhea. Any suggestions on how to avoid buying/eating bad nuts? Should I buy those that come in in sealed boxes (rather than from the bulk food section)? Should I keep them in the fridge once I am at home?

I had meat every meal, every day before the switch. So to my question I guess, is it normal to be this physically ill from switching diets like this?",0

536,New and Nervous,"Hello all;

Let me preface by saying we are literally trying vegetarian meals for the first time and I am making a shopping list while looking at all your beautiful food posts!

We decided to try vegetarianism primarily for climate reasons, as we have a small child that we would like to contribute to the future for. Health benefits nonwithstanding.

I have made tofu once... it was terrible. Probably user error, but tofu really intimidates me now. I want to eat vegetarian, but I also don't want to have to choke down my meals.

I have done some research and for most things, I can just substitute a meal alternative, but they are VERY expensive where I live. A pound of meat substitute for chicken is almost three times the amount of what I am trying to avoid.

I will be having eggs, as I have my own little chicken coop and know how my flutterbirds are treated. (Please don't yell at me about this...)

I am just wondering on some really basic, ingredient essentials to start off. And any tofu advice!

565,The Food Hierarchy: Where is Vegetarianism and its Many Types?,"Plenty of people tend to get vegetarian food confused with all other types of dietary restrictions, so I thought I'd do this, with a semi-rigorous mathematical treatment. 

First off, we have the **universal set, ξ** of **all food _typically_ consumed by people**. I'm certain I'll get pedants here talking about cannibalism and other extreme, exotic and highly hygienic varieties of consumables like Tide Pods, but here I am limiting food to a cultural majority. This, however, means things like insects and dog dicks (apparently a Chinese delicacy) are fair game in this set.

Then, we have three popular dietary restrictions as a result of religion: **Kosher**, **Halal** and **Hindu food**. Kosher and Halal food have much in common, such as the prohibition of pork, the handling of meat, et cetera. The list is too long to elaborate here, and I am neither Jewish nor Muslim, so I cannot claim to know the complete list of prohibited food items.

Hindu food is *almost always* devoid of beef (though, like everything else in Hinduism, there exists a sect that does their own thing). 

A **subset** of the set intersection of these three sets is **pescetarianism**: all plant-based food, dairy, eggs, and seafood is allowed. Personally I find this a rather odd distinction to make, but I suppose people who restrict themselves to these are likely allergic to poultry and bovine/porcine meat. 

Now, things get more complicated. 

We start with **ovo-lacto-vegetarianism** (I'm gonna use OLV, because it's a pain to re-type), which is the group that this subreddit is most familiar with, methinks. This is a subset of pescetarianism, and it means people eat eggs, dairy (of course, cheese *without* bovine rennet), plant material, and animal-derived plant material, like honey. Assuming ingredients are appropriately chosen and the food appropriately cooked, OLV food is a **strict** subset of **both** Kosher and Halal food—so if you have *never, ever* had meat or eggs in your household (like mine), the food you cook is A-OK to be served to Jews and Muslims (any Jews and Muslims here, please correct me on this if I'm wrong).

Then things move to **lacto-vegetarianism** (LV), also called Hindu vegetarianism. This is because nearly everyone who is vegetarian in the world lives in India, is Hindu, and is lacto-vegetarian. As the name suggests, this set here is excludes eggs, making it a strict subset of OLV. 

Beneath lacto-vegetarianism, things don't *immediately* get to veganism. Oh, no. Indian religions have a whole story planned for you. 

**Jain food** is a strict subset of LV food, and doesn't include vegetables of the genus *Allium* (read: onions, garlic, leeks, etc.). There are said to be multiple reasons for this, all typically stemming from Vedic interpretations of the effects of food on the body—apparently such vegetables are aphrodisiacs. Another oft-cited reason is that these are root vegetables (sometimes *other* root vegetables are disallowed, too, like potatoes, yams, carrots, etc), and harvesting them effectively kills the entire plant, thus violating the Hindu/Buddhist/Jain tenet of non-violence, or *ahimsa*. 

Buddhist vegetarians tend to follow this diet, too. Many Hindu vegetarians also adhere to this diet on certain holy days like Navaratri, the anniversary of a family member's passing, etc. Whether this entire *Allium*- and root-vegetable-avoiding idea was originally a Hindu one, or re-imported back from Jainism or Buddhism, is unclear. However, depending on the sect in question, dairy still tends to be allowed. 

Obviously, **vegans** can and do eat *Allium* vegetables, so Jain vegetarian food is not *really* a superset of vegan food, which everyone knows—*nothing*, not even the clothes on one's back, from animals or animal-derived effort, etc. So we have things like vegan cheese, Beyond, Impossible, Morningstar, there exist hundreds of Western brands of meat imitations catering to vegans (I personally hardly ever eat stuff like this, because who needs fake meat when you have Indian food? ^(just kidding please don't pitchfork me, I like fake meat too)). 

Beneath veganism there's **fruitarianism**, where people only eat the fruiting bodies of plants. Steve Jobs was purportedly on this diet. Sounds intense, and I doubt I could ever live like this (unless I was on a remote island).

So the next time someone asks you what diet you're on, point them to this post.",4,"The Food Hierarchy: Where is Vegetarianism and its Many Types? Plenty of people tend to get vegetarian food confused with all other types of dietary restrictions, so I thought I'd do this, with a semi-rigorous mathematical treatment. 

First off, we have the **universal set, ξ** of **all food _typically_ consumed by people**. I'm certain I'll get pedants here talking about cannibalism and other extreme, exotic and highly hygienic varieties of consumables like Tide Pods, but here I am limiting food to a cultural majority. This, however, means things like insects and dog dicks (apparently a Chinese delicacy) are fair game in this set.

Then, we have three popular dietary restrictions as a result of religion: **Kosher**, **Halal** and **Hindu food**. Kosher and Halal food have much in common, such as the prohibition of pork, the handling of meat, et cetera. The list is too long to elaborate here, and I am neither Jewish nor Muslim, so I cannot claim to know the complete list of prohibited food items.

Hindu food is *almost always* devoid of beef (though, like everything else in Hinduism, there exists a sect that does their own thing). 

A **subset** of the set intersection of these three sets is **pescetarianism**: all plant-based food, dairy, eggs, and seafood is allowed. Personally I find this a rather odd distinction to make, but I suppose people who restrict themselves to these are likely allergic to poultry and bovine/porcine meat. 

Now, things get more complicated. 

We start with **ovo-lacto-vegetarianism** (I'm gonna use OLV, because it's a pain to re-type), which is the group that this subreddit is most familiar with, methinks. This is a subset of pescetarianism, and it means people eat eggs, dairy (of course, cheese *without* bovine rennet), plant material, and animal-derived plant material, like honey. Assuming ingredients are appropriately chosen and the food appropriately cooked, OLV food is a **strict** subset of **both** Kosher and Halal food—so if you have *never, ever* had meat or eggs in your household (like mine), the food you cook is A-OK to be served to Jews and Muslims (any Jews and Muslims here, please correct me on this if I'm wrong).

567,Soft texture meals,"Hello vegetarian friends, I am in need of a little assistance.

I've had sharp pain in the back of my mouth for a while and I thought it was probably my wisdom teeth, I scheduled an appointment with the face surgeon and was okay with the fact that I'll need to eat only soup and the like for about ten days.

Well I get to my appointment, and lo and behold, my teeth are alright and I have CMD - basically, my chewing muscle is extremely tense, I need physical therapy for it, and in the meantime I'm forbidden to eat bread, most raw vegetables and anything that is hard to chew. First of all, I am angry about the bread because this is THE breakfast around here (Germany).

I've been making soups, rice with cooked vegetables, and a lot of potatoes and cauliflower mash, but I've been miserable for days now. I can't have any chickpeas - my favourite bean - unless I've made them into hummus and while I make a very good hummus, I don't know how to eat it without fresh veg or bread. My partner doesn't like most kinds of pasta, his favourite is made with meatless meatballs, which are too hard for me to chew. 

My physical therapy begins at the end of October and will continue on for two weeks. I will probably need to stick to this meal plan for longer than that. And I desperately need some ideas to add to it. Ideally I hope someone has had CMD or something similar and can share the experience with me. I avoid dairy and eggs (I would make an exception for eggs from SO's parents' hens but they are not laying any right now) and absolutely cannot eat cilantro (coriander seeds are fine though) or grapefruit.

Thanks in advance.",7,"Soft texture meals Hello vegetarian friends, I am in need of a little assistance.

I've heard different accounts of the relative welfare issues of meat v dairy/eggs and also seen some environmental concerns around some veggie/vegan alternative proteins (soy?) Instinctively I'd assume eating beef is worse environmentally but better ethically than eating chicken (partially conditions, partially just that one cow feeds more than one chicken. But not sure whether e.g. free range meat from small ethical farms is preferable to the vast majority of cheese from mass produced milk.

Are there any sources that weigh up the relative environmental/welfare coats of various animal products?

591,Best Thanksgiving Recipes for a Newby Veggie,"I'm bout to host my first thanksgiving event this weekend with a close group of friends. We have a bit of a potluck thing going on, and most of us are vegetarien so we're going to stick to that kind of menu for the night. Everyone's bringing something, and I'm in charge of allocating main-meal duties as I see fit (mashed potatoes, the likes) to my most trusted cooks. 

I only quit meat a few months ago so I'm still new to the groove and I knew holidays would prove to be tricky due to staples like turkey. I'd be endlessly grateful for a helping hand from Reddit and anyone who has experience in pleasing a crowd of veteran vegetarians!

593,Hemorrhoids after I stopped eating meat? :(,"Hey y’all. 

Experimented with vegetarianism every now and then since I was 16. A month here, four months there, etc. Never made it longer than six months because I’d get stomach problems and my BM would get wack as fuck. 

I’m 21 now and I’ve only eaten meat once or twice since March. It was fine for a while, then started to become a nuisance, and now it’s a problem. 

I eat processed foods from time to time (like veg burgs and other meatless options, and some junk food) but for the most part I eat rice, beans, and vegetables. 

Also, I do drink a lot of caffeine; usually the equivalent of 3-4 cups of coffee. And I drink all caffeine: tea, coffee, yerba mate, energy drinks. I also smoke a half pack a day and about 1g of weed, but I don’t think those things would interfere with my digestion that much. 

And my drug habits have been like that for the past 2 years or so. It’s only when I stop eating meat that I get these stomach problems. 

Can anyone offer me any advice? Like I’m seriously considering going back to eating meat because of how my health has been affected, even though meat absolutely disgusts me now and I plan on cutting out all animal products by the end of next year. 

My shits are literally holding me back.

595,Restaurant Food Mislabeled as Vegetarian,"A Thai restaurant that I frequented until yesterday has “vegetarian” sections of the menu.

Ran to the bathroom, didnt force myself to throw up and it didnt come naturally. Although the panic attack did, along with internal shakes and it coming up to my throat to sit where it still is. Manager was truly, painfully sincere about it and comped the whole meal.

Think Indian Street food x tacos

1) boil small potatoes (as soft as possible without getting mashed, so you can still make slices)

2) slice a fresh tomato.

3) for the chutney (sauce), grind 1:1 ratio of cilantro and mint leaves, 2 small Thai chilis, a few drops of lemon and salt.
If you're close to an Indian store, you can get frozen coriander chutney too.

4) I used frozen parathas for the base. You could use  sandwich bread or whole wheat tortillas as well.
Make sure it's cooked well.

5) generously spread the chutney on to the paratha/base. Layer with slices of boiled potato and tomato. Add salt and pepper.

I added some yogurt as well, but you can skip it if you want to avoid dairy.

626,My whole family is against me going vegetarian,"Alright, here we go.
As the title says, I want to be a vegetarian for ethical reasons (global warming to be one of them), but I also want to do it for myself. 
My father is a hunter so we eat meat on a regular basis. I know that the animals he brings home weren't kept in captivity and haven't suffered in their lives (he knows VERY WELL how to shoot an animal without causing it any pain) so I've always thought that theres no harm in eating it. But since he's been trying to teach me how to hunt, I've developed a since of guilt for these animals. This guilt came after shooting and injuring a boar. 
I know that I can't be a full vegetarian before I'm 18 or still living with them, but I try to keep my meat consumption to a minimum (like, maybe 100 or 200 grams in a week) 
Could any of you help me justify my reasoning with them? Like, give me some facts why eating less meat would be beneficial to all of us?
I'm a F(14) if anyone is wondering",7,"My whole family is against me going vegetarian Alright, here we go.

669,What can I substitute meat with to maintain a protein source in these meals?,"**Disclaimer: Everybody always suggests tofu or other soy. I can't have soy, so please don't suggest a soy-based product. This is why I haven't just gone out and bought mock-meats. Most of them are made with soy.**

My spouse is omnivorous and I'm trying to incorporate more vegetarian and/or vegan meals into our diet that still appeal to an omnivore's palate. He is fine with beans, lentils, legumes, etc. I haven't yet tried making anything with nutritional yeast because I think that would be too much too quick.

Meat interacts with different types of dishes in different ways, so it might be easier to go on a recipe-by-recipe basis.

.

Here are some typical omnivorous meals for us:

Layered enchiladas (lasagna style layered)

Pasta &amp; tomato sauce with veggies

Pesto pasta

Sandwiches (meat &amp; cheese)

Mac &amp; cheese (this is fine, but I need a more protein heavy side because I don't like cheese sauce)

Mock Olive Garden Pasta Fagioli (has ground beef, otherwise fine)

Baked ziti/pasta (spouse finds the dish less fulfilling without ground beef)

Breakfast scrambler (has sausage, looking for a non-meat option that still has spiciness)

Mock Chipotle burrito bowl

.

There's no seafood in there because we don't eat any. There's also no salads because my teeth are *very* crooked and it's hard to eat leafy vegetables (we can't afford extensive dental work). We do meal prepping to save time and money, so most of our meals are things that can be easily frozen for leftovers or lunch the next day.

I could just take out the meat from my portions, but I'm worried about the amount of nutrients and calories I'm getting. I'd like to kill 2 birds with one stone by turning my meals vegetarian and hopefully adding some more nutrients.

If anybody has meal suggestions outside of what I've directly mentioned, please share! I'm always open to recipes. Once I've got a good chunk of recipes to choose from, I can streamline the meal prepping process and never have to surrender to ""well, we could just by ground beef"" because it's on sale and easy to cook.",18,"What can I substitute meat with to maintain a protein source in these meals? **Disclaimer: Everybody always suggests tofu or other soy.

The operation I work on is grass fed only, with hay in the winter.

My boyfriend is vegetarian and we've been together for about a year now. I'm moving in with him in the next few months.

Meat substitutes are great and it doesn't make much difference to me. 

However the one thing I'm stuck on is seafood substitutes. I was wondering if there was anything on the market that was plant-based? I've heard of some 'lobster mushrooms' but no idea where to get them. And I've tried 'Tuno' but it just tasted awful. If it helps I'm based in the UK.

688,Meat tastes different (in a bad way). I m losing my appetite for meat.,"Hello all

&amp;#x200B;

I ll get right to the point. I eat meat all my life (i am 40 yo ) and i enjoy it a lot. Most days of the week i used to eat meat. Any kind of meat. Suddenly about a year ago poultry started to have a different taste and while i eat i get upset stomach. This have expanded to pork and beef meat. They taste kinda different and most of the times i m kind of disgusted.

&amp;#x200B;

Processed meat like sausages or minced meat are not yet a problem . Even though i rarely order takeout, i don't have a problem eating the above processed meats .

&amp;#x200B;

I m not sure what all this means. I am going to inform my doctor in my next week's appointment to try to eliminate the possibility that an infection or a disease has changed my taste. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound familiar to you ? Are people that go vegetarian do it by decision or does some happen to lose their taste for meat before deciding to go that route?

699,I'm going to try being Vegetarian for a few months.,"Afternoon all!

As the title states I'm going to try being vegetarian for a period of 6 months starting November 1st.  I'm doing it both as a challenge to myself as well as using this diet as a way of regulating/tracking what I am eating and how much.  I've done a little research and I think i'm still going to eat eggs/cheese so officially it's going to be a lacto-ovo-vegetarian.  I really don't know how I can go without cheese.

So with that being said i'm looking for things I need to watch out for.  By eliminating my red meats I think an iron supplement can't hurt, but past that I really can't think of anything else I need to worry about.  Also, if I was to eliminate eggs from the diet, would that technically eliminate baked goods like cakes and such that use eggs in the recipe?  That now seems like a dumb question once I typed it out, but i'm gonna leave it for the sake of science.

Also, totally open to suggestions of your favorite cooks you tube channels/blogs/cookbooks to give me ideas on what the hell i'm going to eat.

So with that being said i'm looking for things I need to watch out for.  By eliminating my red meats I think an iron supplement can't hurt, but past that I really can't think of anything else I need to worry about.  Also, if I was to eliminate eggs from the diet, would that technically eliminate baked goods like cakes and such that use eggs in the recipe?  That now seems like a dumb question once I typed it out, but i'm gonna leave it for the sake of science.

Also, totally open to suggestions of your favorite cooks you tube channels/blogs/cookbooks to give me ideas on what the hell i'm going to eat.

702,"Made the switch two weeks ago, been feeling light headed.","A few years ago, I was vegan for a little over a year. The first month of it had me ravenously hungry, but it settled and I felt great afterwards. Two weeks ago, I decided to quit my omniivore ways and go vegetarian as that is more practical for my life right now. However, the severe hunger only lasted a week this time. Now, my problem is that I feel very light headed most days. I eat eggs most mornings, along with dinner containing at least beans or mushrooms every night, if not both. I take a multi vitamin and a B12 every night after dinner. 

Also, a few months ago I went to the doctor to have blood work done. Everything was great except my red blood cells being too large (which my doc said was probably either a B12 or Folate deficiency). My doc wanted me to come back in for more blood work but I haven't because I am terrified of having blood drawn. I know, I'm bad at being an adult. 

Any thoughts on the light headedness? Did it happen to you?",8,"Made the switch two weeks ago, been feeling light headed. A few years ago, I was vegan for a little over a year.

709,Processed Foods,"Hello everyone! I have been hem-hawing about posting about this for a while because lord knows we all deal with enough flack about our food choices, but it's been really, really bugging me. And, I'm coming from a place of concern, not one of finger-pointing so please, please be kind!

I used be a strict vegetarian and was happily consuming brands like Morningstar Farms for their patties and sausages, etc. One day, while reading articles about cleaner eating, I realized that so much of what I was eating was frozen products that are ultra-processed. I know that ""processed"" is a pretty broad term and that any food that isn't simply pulled out of the ground and placed on the shelf as-is is technically processed. 

But, the vegetarian foods just seem ... so, so fake and not in a good way. The ingredients lists are pretty unnerving. And I have to admit, the BeyondMeat products make me feel a little squeaky inside. Are these foods truly healthy? Healthy for us and the planet? I know we all don't have the time or the money to stand in our kitchens all weekend doing food prep for the week, but I'm failing to see how they are at all beneficial especially when it comes to packaging. 

Now, I'll still occasionally buy a tray of Amy's cheese enchiladas and mow down on that sucker like there's no tomorrow, but Amy's has been around for ages and it just seems like these newer companies are just jumping on the latest food trend and are approaching it from a money-making stand point, and not one of health for us or the environment. Are these really the foods we want representing the vegetarian movement (like we really have a choice in the matter, but hopefully you see what I'm getting at). 

Am I worrying about nothing? What say you all?",15,"Processed Foods Hello everyone!

756,Vegetarians without soy,"I'm moving towards a more vegetarian lifestyle.  I'm motivated by health and environmental reason.  I'm not sure if I'll end up being fully vegetarian or not.  I'm interested in the experiences of vegetarians who do not eat soy or resources on the topic.  

Through food journaling I was able to stop my debilitating migraines by eliminating soy.  How much soy I can have, or if organic matters is definitely up in the air, but the testing process really isn't worth it.  I seem to be able to have a bit of soy sauce with sushi.

I'm not sure if I'll end up being fully vegetarian or not.  I'm interested in the experiences of vegetarians who do not eat soy or resources on the topic.  

Through food journaling I was able to stop my debilitating migraines by eliminating soy.  How much soy I can have, or if organic matters is definitely up in the air, but the testing process really isn't worth it.  I seem to be able to have a bit of soy sauce with sushi.

It was more of just trying to eat food that didn't have meat and i wasn't concerned about the minerals and vitamins my body needed and I found it very very hard to get enough protein. Diet mainly consisted of bread, pastas, rice cheese eggs and vegetables like spinach bell peppers and eggplants etc. I became really fatigued all the time to the point where I felt dizzy and felt faintish and had to go to the emergency. They said I was low on iron and had small blood cells and the doctor told me to eat better. I don't really like lentils or blackbeans or chickpeas and I'm not a fan of tofu or soy or fake meats. I know my options were pretty limited so I started eating fish for a month or so ( also because I hate going out to eat and being forced to get a salad or pasta when I don't want that). Yesterday I accidentally ordered a whole fish and it hit me like a brick. I knew that I couldn't eat this anymore and I felt extremely guilty for all the fish I ate recently. I don't know what to do now because I find it's near impossible for me to have a healthy vegetarian diet. If anyone could suggest possible meals that would fulfill my dietary needs or even the specific supplements I should be taking that would be great.

895,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials.

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

Keeping an eye on eco-friendly and sustainable choices doesn’t mean you have to compromise on the beauty and style of your kitchen.

Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless.

***Eco-friendly Cotton Tote*** ***Bags*** **-** Each time an eco-friendly tote is used, a single-use plastic bag is kept out of circulation. They are good personal bags you can use whenever you go to the grocery store, drop by to a post office or even when taking some time off shopping. They can be used for much more than just shopping, these bags can be useful for all your daily needs as well.

910,Pickup owner - so much judgement. My rant.,"I recently sold my house and bought a 19 foot(3600 lb) travel trailer to live in. There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

Having the RV, I need a capable vehicle to tow it, for which I have a pickup truck. It is a 1/2 ton and I chose a regular cab short bed for it's smaller size and maneuverability, while still retaining the amount of capability I require.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

I don't have access to a shower or a sink in my changing room :-(

While I understand some electricity is necessary to run the fan, the misting system and other electronic systems that run this facility it seems like they neglected an alternative that would reduce the amount of electricity necessary to grow these plants.

What if instead of using LEDs to produce the plants they just use mirrors or a reflective surface. If this was in a greenhouse style structure why not have reflective panels on the floor and a reflective hood above the plants so the light from the sun can bounce off the ground onto the panels and down to the plants, naturally you'd need a good amount of ventilation to keep the amount of heat down since LEDs don't produce much if any heat and the sun does but it seems like it would even out since you can run a fan on a Stirling engine to harness the heat or off solar panels that can be mounted around the greenhouse, I need feedback because I could see this being revolutionary for the food industry but it just shifting the demand for water for a demand for electricity.",5,"Vertical Farm Video: Possible solution to major flaw.

1000,Finding the balance point. (Philosophy),"Life is about maintaining a healthy balance. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Everything is better in moderation. Are these statements still true in regards to pursuing a low impact lifestyle? Are there limits to the degree one should attempt to reduce our consumption and energy use, or should we reduce our impact at all costs? If so, what are these limits, and what defines them as the cut off point?

For example: I once had a roommate who would put all his used glass jars in our cupboard to re-use as drinking glasses. Eventually he had saved up so many that they were piled up on the shelf. I went to grab a glass, and they tumbled out, hitting each other and shattering mid-air. This caused broken glass to rain down on me and I got a few good cuts.

The mindset my roommate demonstrated is a slippery slope toward a hoarder mentality: saving every little object because you see in it a value and potential for future use. Luckily he never took it this far.

Similarly, while driving with a friend recently, he made a turn and accidentally didn't put on his turn signal. (Reddit's biggest pet peeve). Although he was joking, he made a comment that struck me. He said: ""Hey, I was just saving electricity!"" 

An extreme version of the idea my friend had would be to use no electricity, even when it is important for safety. This would mean no bike lights, no turn signals, and no traffic lights. Although it would be an energy-saving society, it wouldn't be safe.

These slippery slopes can be found throughout many issues in the environmental movement. I believe that for each one, there is a healthy point of balance. These balance points maintain parts of the sustainability goal while also maintaining parts of the health or safety aspect of the issue.

The ultimate, morbid incarnation of this dilemma is the issue of life itself. Life requires consumption. Someone who truly desires to create zero impact might feel pressured to take their own life. Garret Hardin, the amazing man who conceived of The Tragedy of the Commons, killed himself for these reasons. Taking a good idea too far is a very dangerous thing. There is no need for anyone to take their life to reduce consumption. 

I believe the limits of our low-impact efforts can be defined in a similar way to how the limits of mental disorders are defined: Eccentricity is fine until it becomes severe enough to cause serious issues in one's own or others' lives. Similarly, pursuing a low-impact lifestyle is great until one pushes it far enough to end up hurting themselves or others.

What are your thoughts on these issues? Do you believe there are any limits? What defines them? What low-impact lifestyle choices can you think of that are good in moderation but dangerous in excess?

My colleagues and I travel a lot for work and we are trying to build a case for management to offset all this travel via donations/etc to some green-fund (actual solution tbd).

Having actual data on our carbon footprint (which is likely significantly greater than the average American) would go a long ways to convincing management. Unfortunately, having everyone in the team dig through even 3 months of flights would take a considerable amount of time and many people would likely deprioritize it. Ideally, there's a tool out there that reads through itineraries in email, or looks at travel aggregators (like Orbitz or Kayak) to quickly sum up flight-related carbon.

Any ideas or recommendations are super helpful!

1045,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless.

There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

Having the RV, I need a capable vehicle to tow it, for which I have a pickup truck. It is a 1/2 ton and I chose a regular cab short bed for it's smaller size and maneuverability, while still retaining the amount of capability I require.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

1078,Suggestions on 'showering' after a cycle commute with limited access to water.,"Hello, this is my fist post, not sure if it's in the right place but I'm looking for a more eco friendly way of cleaning myself after a longish commute on a bike.

I currently use a product by muc-off called dry shower. The idea is you squirt a few handfuls and rub it onto your skin and wipe off with a towel. It's supposed to kill bacteria and get rid of sweat. It does quite a good job but I'm looking for a more I guess home made / plastic free alternative.

I don't have access to a shower or a sink in my changing room :-(

Any suggestions would be great!

1150,Finding the balance point. (Philosophy),"Life is about maintaining a healthy balance. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Everything is better in moderation. Are these statements still true in regards to pursuing a low impact lifestyle? Are there limits to the degree one should attempt to reduce our consumption and energy use, or should we reduce our impact at all costs? If so, what are these limits, and what defines them as the cut off point?

For example: I once had a roommate who would put all his used glass jars in our cupboard to re-use as drinking glasses. Eventually he had saved up so many that they were piled up on the shelf. I went to grab a glass, and they tumbled out, hitting each other and shattering mid-air. This caused broken glass to rain down on me and I got a few good cuts.

The mindset my roommate demonstrated is a slippery slope toward a hoarder mentality: saving every little object because you see in it a value and potential for future use. Luckily he never took it this far.

Similarly, while driving with a friend recently, he made a turn and accidentally didn't put on his turn signal. (Reddit's biggest pet peeve). Although he was joking, he made a comment that struck me. He said: ""Hey, I was just saving electricity!"" 

An extreme version of the idea my friend had would be to use no electricity, even when it is important for safety. This would mean no bike lights, no turn signals, and no traffic lights. Although it would be an energy-saving society, it wouldn't be safe.

These slippery slopes can be found throughout many issues in the environmental movement. I believe that for each one, there is a healthy point of balance. These balance points maintain parts of the sustainability goal while also maintaining parts of the health or safety aspect of the issue.

The ultimate, morbid incarnation of this dilemma is the issue of life itself. Life requires consumption. Someone who truly desires to create zero impact might feel pressured to take their own life. Garret Hardin, the amazing man who conceived of The Tragedy of the Commons, killed himself for these reasons. Taking a good idea too far is a very dangerous thing. There is no need for anyone to take their life to reduce consumption. 

I believe the limits of our low-impact efforts can be defined in a similar way to how the limits of mental disorders are defined: Eccentricity is fine until it becomes severe enough to cause serious issues in one's own or others' lives. Similarly, pursuing a low-impact lifestyle is great until one pushes it far enough to end up hurting themselves or others.

What are your thoughts on these issues? Do you believe there are any limits? What defines them? What low-impact lifestyle choices can you think of that are good in moderation but dangerous in excess?

Those agriculturists who think of the problems of food production solely in terms of technological innovation are oversimplifying both the practicalities of production and the network of meanings and values necessary to define, nurture, and preserve the practical motivations. That the discipline of agriculture should have been so divorced from other disciplines has its immediate cause in the compartmental structure of the universities, in which complementary, mutually sustaining and enriching disciplines are divided, according to ""professions,"" into fragmented, one-eyed specialties ... However, if we conceive of a culture as one body, which it is, we see that all of its disciplines are everybody's business, and that the proper university product is therefore not the whittled-down, isolated mentality of expertise, but a mind competent of all its concerns.

Those agriculturists who think of the problems of food production solely in terms of technological innovation are oversimplifying both the practicalities of production and the network of meanings and values necessary to define, nurture, and preserve the practical motivations. That the discipline of agriculture should have been so divorced from other disciplines has its immediate cause in the compartmental structure of the universities, in which complementary, mutually sustaining and enriching disciplines are divided, according to ""professions,"" into fragmented, one-eyed specialties ... However, if we conceive of a culture as one body, which it is, we see that all of its disciplines are everybody's business, and that the proper university product is therefore not the whittled-down, isolated mentality of expertise, but a mind competent of all its concerns.

What is the best way to hand wash dishes in one of those double sink setups? Is one for rinsing? Isn't it going to get filled with nasty water and not really clean the dishes?

I currently just wash one dish at a time. I soap it up and then rinse it off. I pretty much have to keep the water running constantly to do this, which can be at least ten minutes.

I want to find a balance between conserving water and making sure the dishes are thoroughly washed.

1195,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials.

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless.

***Eco-friendly Cotton Tote*** ***Bags*** **-** Each time an eco-friendly tote is used, a single-use plastic bag is kept out of circulation. They are good personal bags you can use whenever you go to the grocery store, drop by to a post office or even when taking some time off shopping. They can be used for much more than just shopping, these bags can be useful for all your daily needs as well.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless. 

***Eco-friendly Cotton Produce Bags*** **-** Seeing your groceries go spilling across the ground, potentially breaking glass bottles or damaging fruit and veggies means you need a better option for this task. [Shop eco-friendly produce bags](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Multipurpose-Drawstring-Closure-Shopping/dp/B07FKKCWM5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1R2NGY98CPVA6&amp;keywords=daily+home+essentials+produce+bags&amp;qid=1562160040&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=Daily+Home+Essentials+%2Caps%2C351&amp;sr=8-3) from Daily Home Essentials to be sure that they will stand up to the grocery carrying challenge every single time!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Tote*** ***Bags*** **-** Each time an eco-friendly tote is used, a single-use plastic bag is kept out of circulation. They are good personal bags you can use whenever you go to the grocery store, drop by to a post office or even when taking some time off shopping. They can be used for much more than just shopping, these bags can be useful for all your daily needs as well.

1210,Pickup owner - so much judgement. My rant.,"I recently sold my house and bought a 19 foot(3600 lb) travel trailer to live in. There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

Having the RV, I need a capable vehicle to tow it, for which I have a pickup truck. It is a 1/2 ton and I chose a regular cab short bed for it's smaller size and maneuverability, while still retaining the amount of capability I require.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

While I understand some electricity is necessary to run the fan, the misting system and other electronic systems that run this facility it seems like they neglected an alternative that would reduce the amount of electricity necessary to grow these plants.

What if instead of using LEDs to produce the plants they just use mirrors or a reflective surface. If this was in a greenhouse style structure why not have reflective panels on the floor and a reflective hood above the plants so the light from the sun can bounce off the ground onto the panels and down to the plants, naturally you'd need a good amount of ventilation to keep the amount of heat down since LEDs don't produce much if any heat and the sun does but it seems like it would even out since you can run a fan on a Stirling engine to harness the heat or off solar panels that can be mounted around the greenhouse, I need feedback because I could see this being revolutionary for the food industry but it just shifting the demand for water for a demand for electricity.",5,"Vertical Farm Video: Possible solution to major flaw.

1300,Finding the balance point. (Philosophy),"Life is about maintaining a healthy balance. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Everything is better in moderation. Are these statements still true in regards to pursuing a low impact lifestyle? Are there limits to the degree one should attempt to reduce our consumption and energy use, or should we reduce our impact at all costs? If so, what are these limits, and what defines them as the cut off point?

For example: I once had a roommate who would put all his used glass jars in our cupboard to re-use as drinking glasses. Eventually he had saved up so many that they were piled up on the shelf. I went to grab a glass, and they tumbled out, hitting each other and shattering mid-air. This caused broken glass to rain down on me and I got a few good cuts.

The mindset my roommate demonstrated is a slippery slope toward a hoarder mentality: saving every little object because you see in it a value and potential for future use. Luckily he never took it this far.

Similarly, while driving with a friend recently, he made a turn and accidentally didn't put on his turn signal. (Reddit's biggest pet peeve). Although he was joking, he made a comment that struck me. He said: ""Hey, I was just saving electricity!"" 

An extreme version of the idea my friend had would be to use no electricity, even when it is important for safety. This would mean no bike lights, no turn signals, and no traffic lights. Although it would be an energy-saving society, it wouldn't be safe.

These slippery slopes can be found throughout many issues in the environmental movement. I believe that for each one, there is a healthy point of balance. These balance points maintain parts of the sustainability goal while also maintaining parts of the health or safety aspect of the issue.

The ultimate, morbid incarnation of this dilemma is the issue of life itself. Life requires consumption. Someone who truly desires to create zero impact might feel pressured to take their own life. Garret Hardin, the amazing man who conceived of The Tragedy of the Commons, killed himself for these reasons. Taking a good idea too far is a very dangerous thing. There is no need for anyone to take their life to reduce consumption. 

I believe the limits of our low-impact efforts can be defined in a similar way to how the limits of mental disorders are defined: Eccentricity is fine until it becomes severe enough to cause serious issues in one's own or others' lives. Similarly, pursuing a low-impact lifestyle is great until one pushes it far enough to end up hurting themselves or others.

What are your thoughts on these issues? Do you believe there are any limits? What defines them? What low-impact lifestyle choices can you think of that are good in moderation but dangerous in excess?

My colleagues and I travel a lot for work and we are trying to build a case for management to offset all this travel via donations/etc to some green-fund (actual solution tbd).

Having actual data on our carbon footprint (which is likely significantly greater than the average American) would go a long ways to convincing management. Unfortunately, having everyone in the team dig through even 3 months of flights would take a considerable amount of time and many people would likely deprioritize it. Ideally, there's a tool out there that reads through itineraries in email, or looks at travel aggregators (like Orbitz or Kayak) to quickly sum up flight-related carbon.

Any ideas or recommendations are super helpful!

1345,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Produce Bags](https://i.redd.it/o5pin5up8n931.jpg)

Replace plastic shopping bags for reusable totes and produce bags. [Shop eco-friendly produce bags](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Multipurpose-Produce-Drawstring-Closure/dp/B07FKHK72R?ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) and totes from Daily Home Essentials; take the eco-friendly route.

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless.

There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

Having the RV, I need a capable vehicle to tow it, for which I have a pickup truck. It is a 1/2 ton and I chose a regular cab short bed for it's smaller size and maneuverability, while still retaining the amount of capability I require.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

I currently use a product by muc-off called dry shower. The idea is you squirt a few handfuls and rub it onto your skin and wipe off with a towel. It's supposed to kill bacteria and get rid of sweat. It does quite a good job but I'm looking for a more I guess home made / plastic free alternative.

I don't have access to a shower or a sink in my changing room :-(

Any suggestions would be great!

1450,Finding the balance point. (Philosophy),"Life is about maintaining a healthy balance. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Everything is better in moderation. Are these statements still true in regards to pursuing a low impact lifestyle? Are there limits to the degree one should attempt to reduce our consumption and energy use, or should we reduce our impact at all costs? If so, what are these limits, and what defines them as the cut off point?

For example: I once had a roommate who would put all his used glass jars in our cupboard to re-use as drinking glasses. Eventually he had saved up so many that they were piled up on the shelf. I went to grab a glass, and they tumbled out, hitting each other and shattering mid-air. This caused broken glass to rain down on me and I got a few good cuts.

The mindset my roommate demonstrated is a slippery slope toward a hoarder mentality: saving every little object because you see in it a value and potential for future use. Luckily he never took it this far.

Similarly, while driving with a friend recently, he made a turn and accidentally didn't put on his turn signal. (Reddit's biggest pet peeve). Although he was joking, he made a comment that struck me. He said: ""Hey, I was just saving electricity!"" 

An extreme version of the idea my friend had would be to use no electricity, even when it is important for safety. This would mean no bike lights, no turn signals, and no traffic lights. Although it would be an energy-saving society, it wouldn't be safe.

These slippery slopes can be found throughout many issues in the environmental movement. I believe that for each one, there is a healthy point of balance. These balance points maintain parts of the sustainability goal while also maintaining parts of the health or safety aspect of the issue.

The ultimate, morbid incarnation of this dilemma is the issue of life itself. Life requires consumption. Someone who truly desires to create zero impact might feel pressured to take their own life. Garret Hardin, the amazing man who conceived of The Tragedy of the Commons, killed himself for these reasons. Taking a good idea too far is a very dangerous thing. There is no need for anyone to take their life to reduce consumption. 

I believe the limits of our low-impact efforts can be defined in a similar way to how the limits of mental disorders are defined: Eccentricity is fine until it becomes severe enough to cause serious issues in one's own or others' lives. Similarly, pursuing a low-impact lifestyle is great until one pushes it far enough to end up hurting themselves or others.

What are your thoughts on these issues? Do you believe there are any limits? What defines them? What low-impact lifestyle choices can you think of that are good in moderation but dangerous in excess?

1462,"""My point is that food is a cultural product; it cannot be produced by technology alone . . .""","&gt;My point is that food is a cultural product; it cannot be produced by technology alone. Those agriculturists who think of the problems of food production solely in terms of technological innovation are oversimplifying both the practicalities of production and the network of meanings and values necessary to define, nurture, and preserve the practical motivations. That the discipline of agriculture should have been so divorced from other disciplines has its immediate cause in the compartmental structure of the universities, in which complementary, mutually sustaining and enriching disciplines are divided, according to ""professions,"" into fragmented, one-eyed specialties ... However, if we conceive of a culture as one body, which it is, we see that all of its disciplines are everybody's business, and that the proper university product is therefore not the whittled-down, isolated mentality of expertise, but a mind competent of all its concerns.

1495,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials.

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

1498,Why You Should Switch to Eco-friendly bags?,"Plastic hasn’t been around for long. But it’s become one of the greatest environmental issues of our times. Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless. 

***Eco-friendly Cotton Produce Bags*** **-** Seeing your groceries go spilling across the ground, potentially breaking glass bottles or damaging fruit and veggies means you need a better option for this task. [Shop eco-friendly produce bags](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Multipurpose-Drawstring-Closure-Shopping/dp/B07FKKCWM5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1R2NGY98CPVA6&amp;keywords=daily+home+essentials+produce+bags&amp;qid=1562160040&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=Daily+Home+Essentials+%2Caps%2C351&amp;sr=8-3) from Daily Home Essentials to be sure that they will stand up to the grocery carrying challenge every single time!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Laundry Bags*** **–** Daily Home Essentials’ laundry bags are strong and durable. They also last a long time, so you know you’ll be safe for heavy-duty laundry loads or for moving them. And what more? They are stylish and classy too, taking an elegant corner of your room!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Tote*** ***Bags*** **-** Each time an eco-friendly tote is used, a single-use plastic bag is kept out of circulation. They are good personal bags you can use whenever you go to the grocery store, drop by to a post office or even when taking some time off shopping. They can be used for much more than just shopping, these bags can be useful for all your daily needs as well.

Plastic hasn’t been around for long. But it’s become one of the greatest environmental issues of our times. Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless. 

***Eco-friendly Cotton Produce Bags*** **-** Seeing your groceries go spilling across the ground, potentially breaking glass bottles or damaging fruit and veggies means you need a better option for this task. [Shop eco-friendly produce bags](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Multipurpose-Drawstring-Closure-Shopping/dp/B07FKKCWM5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1R2NGY98CPVA6&amp;keywords=daily+home+essentials+produce+bags&amp;qid=1562160040&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=Daily+Home+Essentials+%2Caps%2C351&amp;sr=8-3) from Daily Home Essentials to be sure that they will stand up to the grocery carrying challenge every single time!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Laundry Bags*** **–** Daily Home Essentials’ laundry bags are strong and durable. They also last a long time, so you know you’ll be safe for heavy-duty laundry loads or for moving them. And what more? They are stylish and classy too, taking an elegant corner of your room!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Tote*** ***Bags*** **-** Each time an eco-friendly tote is used, a single-use plastic bag is kept out of circulation. They are good personal bags you can use whenever you go to the grocery store, drop by to a post office or even when taking some time off shopping. They can be used for much more than just shopping, these bags can be useful for all your daily needs as well.

1510,Pickup owner - so much judgement. My rant.,"I recently sold my house and bought a 19 foot(3600 lb) travel trailer to live in. There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

Having the RV, I need a capable vehicle to tow it, for which I have a pickup truck. It is a 1/2 ton and I chose a regular cab short bed for it's smaller size and maneuverability, while still retaining the amount of capability I require.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

I currently use a product by muc-off called dry shower. The idea is you squirt a few handfuls and rub it onto your skin and wipe off with a towel. It's supposed to kill bacteria and get rid of sweat. It does quite a good job but I'm looking for a more I guess home made / plastic free alternative.

I don't have access to a shower or a sink in my changing room :-(

[www.noplanetbfestival.com](https://www.noplanetbfestival.com)  / Instagram: @noplanetbfestival

No Planet B Festival is taking place this August 17th\-19th has been born out of a desire to bring vegans, minimalists, zero wasters and the ‘Just Curious’ together for talks, workshops and fitness activities from the best experts in their fields such James Aspey, Shia Shu, Aine Carlin, Kristen Leo, Active Vegans, Girl Gone Green and many more...

The vision is to unite the largest social movements of our time to spread awareness about how to live in a more sustainable and ethical way. 

I would love to hear your feedback :\)

While I understand some electricity is necessary to run the fan, the misting system and other electronic systems that run this facility it seems like they neglected an alternative that would reduce the amount of electricity necessary to grow these plants.

What if instead of using LEDs to produce the plants they just use mirrors or a reflective surface. If this was in a greenhouse style structure why not have reflective panels on the floor and a reflective hood above the plants so the light from the sun can bounce off the ground onto the panels and down to the plants, naturally you'd need a good amount of ventilation to keep the amount of heat down since LEDs don't produce much if any heat and the sun does but it seems like it would even out since you can run a fan on a Stirling engine to harness the heat or off solar panels that can be mounted around the greenhouse, I need feedback because I could see this being revolutionary for the food industry but it just shifting the demand for water for a demand for electricity.",5,"Vertical Farm Video: Possible solution to major flaw.

What if there was a product / solution to help us solve this problem, what do you think it should have ?

1600,Finding the balance point. (Philosophy),"Life is about maintaining a healthy balance. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Everything is better in moderation. Are these statements still true in regards to pursuing a low impact lifestyle? Are there limits to the degree one should attempt to reduce our consumption and energy use, or should we reduce our impact at all costs? If so, what are these limits, and what defines them as the cut off point?

For example: I once had a roommate who would put all his used glass jars in our cupboard to re-use as drinking glasses. Eventually he had saved up so many that they were piled up on the shelf. I went to grab a glass, and they tumbled out, hitting each other and shattering mid-air. This caused broken glass to rain down on me and I got a few good cuts.

The mindset my roommate demonstrated is a slippery slope toward a hoarder mentality: saving every little object because you see in it a value and potential for future use. Luckily he never took it this far.

Similarly, while driving with a friend recently, he made a turn and accidentally didn't put on his turn signal. (Reddit's biggest pet peeve). Although he was joking, he made a comment that struck me. He said: ""Hey, I was just saving electricity!"" 

An extreme version of the idea my friend had would be to use no electricity, even when it is important for safety. This would mean no bike lights, no turn signals, and no traffic lights. Although it would be an energy-saving society, it wouldn't be safe.

These slippery slopes can be found throughout many issues in the environmental movement. I believe that for each one, there is a healthy point of balance. These balance points maintain parts of the sustainability goal while also maintaining parts of the health or safety aspect of the issue.

The ultimate, morbid incarnation of this dilemma is the issue of life itself. Life requires consumption. Someone who truly desires to create zero impact might feel pressured to take their own life. Garret Hardin, the amazing man who conceived of The Tragedy of the Commons, killed himself for these reasons. Taking a good idea too far is a very dangerous thing. There is no need for anyone to take their life to reduce consumption. 

I believe the limits of our low-impact efforts can be defined in a similar way to how the limits of mental disorders are defined: Eccentricity is fine until it becomes severe enough to cause serious issues in one's own or others' lives. Similarly, pursuing a low-impact lifestyle is great until one pushes it far enough to end up hurting themselves or others.

What are your thoughts on these issues? Do you believe there are any limits? What defines them? What low-impact lifestyle choices can you think of that are good in moderation but dangerous in excess?

My colleagues and I travel a lot for work and we are trying to build a case for management to offset all this travel via donations/etc to some green-fund (actual solution tbd).

Having actual data on our carbon footprint (which is likely significantly greater than the average American) would go a long ways to convincing management. Unfortunately, having everyone in the team dig through even 3 months of flights would take a considerable amount of time and many people would likely deprioritize it. Ideally, there's a tool out there that reads through itineraries in email, or looks at travel aggregators (like Orbitz or Kayak) to quickly sum up flight-related carbon.

1645,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless.

There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

I currently mostly uses mechanical pencils (which I plan on refilling), so would swapping be a wise idea? and can you guys give me a further insight into the environmental impact on whiteboard pens, as I know very little about the topic?

I currently use a product by muc-off called dry shower. The idea is you squirt a few handfuls and rub it onto your skin and wipe off with a towel. It's supposed to kill bacteria and get rid of sweat. It does quite a good job but I'm looking for a more I guess home made / plastic free alternative.

I don't have access to a shower or a sink in my changing room :-(

Any suggestions would be great!

1750,Finding the balance point. (Philosophy),"Life is about maintaining a healthy balance. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Everything is better in moderation. Are these statements still true in regards to pursuing a low impact lifestyle? Are there limits to the degree one should attempt to reduce our consumption and energy use, or should we reduce our impact at all costs? If so, what are these limits, and what defines them as the cut off point?

For example: I once had a roommate who would put all his used glass jars in our cupboard to re-use as drinking glasses. Eventually he had saved up so many that they were piled up on the shelf. I went to grab a glass, and they tumbled out, hitting each other and shattering mid-air. This caused broken glass to rain down on me and I got a few good cuts.

The mindset my roommate demonstrated is a slippery slope toward a hoarder mentality: saving every little object because you see in it a value and potential for future use. Luckily he never took it this far.

Similarly, while driving with a friend recently, he made a turn and accidentally didn't put on his turn signal. (Reddit's biggest pet peeve). Although he was joking, he made a comment that struck me. He said: ""Hey, I was just saving electricity!"" 

An extreme version of the idea my friend had would be to use no electricity, even when it is important for safety. This would mean no bike lights, no turn signals, and no traffic lights. Although it would be an energy-saving society, it wouldn't be safe.

These slippery slopes can be found throughout many issues in the environmental movement. I believe that for each one, there is a healthy point of balance. These balance points maintain parts of the sustainability goal while also maintaining parts of the health or safety aspect of the issue.

The ultimate, morbid incarnation of this dilemma is the issue of life itself. Life requires consumption. Someone who truly desires to create zero impact might feel pressured to take their own life. Garret Hardin, the amazing man who conceived of The Tragedy of the Commons, killed himself for these reasons. Taking a good idea too far is a very dangerous thing. There is no need for anyone to take their life to reduce consumption. 

I believe the limits of our low-impact efforts can be defined in a similar way to how the limits of mental disorders are defined: Eccentricity is fine until it becomes severe enough to cause serious issues in one's own or others' lives. Similarly, pursuing a low-impact lifestyle is great until one pushes it far enough to end up hurting themselves or others.

What are your thoughts on these issues? Do you believe there are any limits? What defines them? What low-impact lifestyle choices can you think of that are good in moderation but dangerous in excess?

Those agriculturists who think of the problems of food production solely in terms of technological innovation are oversimplifying both the practicalities of production and the network of meanings and values necessary to define, nurture, and preserve the practical motivations. That the discipline of agriculture should have been so divorced from other disciplines has its immediate cause in the compartmental structure of the universities, in which complementary, mutually sustaining and enriching disciplines are divided, according to ""professions,"" into fragmented, one-eyed specialties ... However, if we conceive of a culture as one body, which it is, we see that all of its disciplines are everybody's business, and that the proper university product is therefore not the whittled-down, isolated mentality of expertise, but a mind competent of all its concerns.

1795,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials.

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

1798,Why You Should Switch to Eco-friendly bags?,"Plastic hasn’t been around for long. But it’s become one of the greatest environmental issues of our times. Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless. 

***Eco-friendly Cotton Produce Bags*** **-** Seeing your groceries go spilling across the ground, potentially breaking glass bottles or damaging fruit and veggies means you need a better option for this task. [Shop eco-friendly produce bags](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Multipurpose-Drawstring-Closure-Shopping/dp/B07FKKCWM5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1R2NGY98CPVA6&amp;keywords=daily+home+essentials+produce+bags&amp;qid=1562160040&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=Daily+Home+Essentials+%2Caps%2C351&amp;sr=8-3) from Daily Home Essentials to be sure that they will stand up to the grocery carrying challenge every single time!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Laundry Bags*** **–** Daily Home Essentials’ laundry bags are strong and durable. They also last a long time, so you know you’ll be safe for heavy-duty laundry loads or for moving them. And what more? They are stylish and classy too, taking an elegant corner of your room!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Tote*** ***Bags*** **-** Each time an eco-friendly tote is used, a single-use plastic bag is kept out of circulation. They are good personal bags you can use whenever you go to the grocery store, drop by to a post office or even when taking some time off shopping. They can be used for much more than just shopping, these bags can be useful for all your daily needs as well.

The benefits to the environment are so notable that buying reusable bags can be considered a big step toward living eco-friendly.",6,"Why You Should Switch to Eco-friendly bags? Plastic hasn’t been around for long. But it’s become one of the greatest environmental issues of our times. Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless. 

***Eco-friendly Cotton Produce Bags*** **-** Seeing your groceries go spilling across the ground, potentially breaking glass bottles or damaging fruit and veggies means you need a better option for this task. [Shop eco-friendly produce bags](https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Multipurpose-Drawstring-Closure-Shopping/dp/B07FKKCWM5/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1R2NGY98CPVA6&amp;keywords=daily+home+essentials+produce+bags&amp;qid=1562160040&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=Daily+Home+Essentials+%2Caps%2C351&amp;sr=8-3) from Daily Home Essentials to be sure that they will stand up to the grocery carrying challenge every single time!

***Eco-friendly Cotton Laundry Bags*** **–** Daily Home Essentials’ laundry bags are strong and durable. They also last a long time, so you know you’ll be safe for heavy-duty laundry loads or for moving them. And what more? They are stylish and classy too, taking an elegant corner of your room!

1810,Pickup owner - so much judgement. My rant.,"I recently sold my house and bought a 19 foot(3600 lb) travel trailer to live in. There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

Having the RV, I need a capable vehicle to tow it, for which I have a pickup truck. It is a 1/2 ton and I chose a regular cab short bed for it's smaller size and maneuverability, while still retaining the amount of capability I require.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

Chris ",0,"UK's first 100% Zero-Waste &amp; Vegan Festival Hey everyone, 

My name is Chris and I am launching a Zero\-Waste and Vegan festival this summer and looking to spread the word to fellow vegans and eco\-conscious warriors.

I asked the moderator If it would be ok to share the festival website with you so please excuse if this feels like a promotion, I simply just want to make more like\-minded people aware of the festival.

[www.noplanetbfestival.com](https://www.noplanetbfestival.com)  / Instagram: @noplanetbfestival

No Planet B Festival is taking place this August 17th\-19th has been born out of a desire to bring vegans, minimalists, zero wasters and the ‘Just Curious’ together for talks, workshops and fitness activities from the best experts in their fields such James Aspey, Shia Shu, Aine Carlin, Kristen Leo, Active Vegans, Girl Gone Green and many more...

The vision is to unite the largest social movements of our time to spread awareness about how to live in a more sustainable and ethical way. 

I would love to hear your feedback :\)

While I understand some electricity is necessary to run the fan, the misting system and other electronic systems that run this facility it seems like they neglected an alternative that would reduce the amount of electricity necessary to grow these plants.

What if instead of using LEDs to produce the plants they just use mirrors or a reflective surface. If this was in a greenhouse style structure why not have reflective panels on the floor and a reflective hood above the plants so the light from the sun can bounce off the ground onto the panels and down to the plants, naturally you'd need a good amount of ventilation to keep the amount of heat down since LEDs don't produce much if any heat and the sun does but it seems like it would even out since you can run a fan on a Stirling engine to harness the heat or off solar panels that can be mounted around the greenhouse, I need feedback because I could see this being revolutionary for the food industry but it just shifting the demand for water for a demand for electricity.",5,"Vertical Farm Video: Possible solution to major flaw.

1900,Finding the balance point. (Philosophy),"Life is about maintaining a healthy balance. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Everything is better in moderation. Are these statements still true in regards to pursuing a low impact lifestyle? Are there limits to the degree one should attempt to reduce our consumption and energy use, or should we reduce our impact at all costs? If so, what are these limits, and what defines them as the cut off point?

For example: I once had a roommate who would put all his used glass jars in our cupboard to re-use as drinking glasses. Eventually he had saved up so many that they were piled up on the shelf. I went to grab a glass, and they tumbled out, hitting each other and shattering mid-air. This caused broken glass to rain down on me and I got a few good cuts.

The mindset my roommate demonstrated is a slippery slope toward a hoarder mentality: saving every little object because you see in it a value and potential for future use. Luckily he never took it this far.

Similarly, while driving with a friend recently, he made a turn and accidentally didn't put on his turn signal. (Reddit's biggest pet peeve). Although he was joking, he made a comment that struck me. He said: ""Hey, I was just saving electricity!"" 

An extreme version of the idea my friend had would be to use no electricity, even when it is important for safety. This would mean no bike lights, no turn signals, and no traffic lights. Although it would be an energy-saving society, it wouldn't be safe.

These slippery slopes can be found throughout many issues in the environmental movement. I believe that for each one, there is a healthy point of balance. These balance points maintain parts of the sustainability goal while also maintaining parts of the health or safety aspect of the issue.

The ultimate, morbid incarnation of this dilemma is the issue of life itself. Life requires consumption. Someone who truly desires to create zero impact might feel pressured to take their own life. Garret Hardin, the amazing man who conceived of The Tragedy of the Commons, killed himself for these reasons. Taking a good idea too far is a very dangerous thing. There is no need for anyone to take their life to reduce consumption. 

I believe the limits of our low-impact efforts can be defined in a similar way to how the limits of mental disorders are defined: Eccentricity is fine until it becomes severe enough to cause serious issues in one's own or others' lives. Similarly, pursuing a low-impact lifestyle is great until one pushes it far enough to end up hurting themselves or others.

What are your thoughts on these issues? Do you believe there are any limits? What defines them? What low-impact lifestyle choices can you think of that are good in moderation but dangerous in excess?

Having actual data on our carbon footprint (which is likely significantly greater than the average American) would go a long ways to convincing management. Unfortunately, having everyone in the team dig through even 3 months of flights would take a considerable amount of time and many people would likely deprioritize it. Ideally, there's a tool out there that reads through itineraries in email, or looks at travel aggregators (like Orbitz or Kayak) to quickly sum up flight-related carbon.

1945,Sustainable Alternatives to Your Kitchen Needs,"  

Out of any room in any house, none feels so much like home as the kitchen. The concept of eco-friendly products stresses on the fact that their production and use does not harm the environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Cotton Kitchen Cloth](https://i.redd.it/mw8027jz8n931.jpg)

An eco-friendly kitchen is a perfectly attainable goal. Even merely changing a few of your habits will help you to head in the right direction. If you’re concerned about your home’s impact on the environment, you’ll be relieved to know that there are plenty of ways you can make your kitchen a little eco-friendlier. 

**How Can We Avoid Plastic in Kitchen?** 

Ban paper and plastic entirely from your kitchen with reusable produce bags, kitchen towels, and dishcloths. Try the following ideas to get started.

**Ditch the Disposables**

Disposable items use up resources, create waste, and cost extra money. The responsible approach is to include as many green choices as possible. Generally, environmentally friendly products are considered to be expensive in nature, but, in the long run, they actually help you save money. These products last longer and tend to be of high quality and more durable in nature.

**Go Plastic-free**

A plastic-free kitchen space promotes a healthier lifestyle as it eliminates the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals. You’ll find millions of single-use plastic bags discarded each year and most of them end up in a landfill. Off late, there has been an awareness regarding how damaging plastic use can be for the environment. So, anything that you can do to prevent the use of plastic is definitely recommended.

**Use reusable materials**

One easy way to commit to greener living is vowing to ditch wasteful paper towels in favor of sustainable alternatives like cloth towels and kitchen towels. Reduce the amount of plastic in your kitchen by switching to reusable materials. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Use cloths instead of paper towels**

Instead of paper towels, use Cotton Dishcloths for kitchen cleanups and spills. Reusable cloths mean less waste by saving paper towels from being used and thrown straight into the garbage. To improve your family’s health, make your kitchen a plastic-free zone. 

**Get in the habit of Recycle** 

Recycling by having a dedicated bin for recyclables in your kitchen. Keep an eye out for plastics with recycling codes #1 and #2 (including containers like soft drinks, salad dressing, milk jugs, and shampoos) - these ones belong in the recycle bin!

Plastic products litter almost every space conceivable on the planet. Single-use plastic, as a material, is the real perpetrator and we need alternatives across the board. The biggest challenge to making that transition is actually doing it. 

Here are some reasons for you to switch to cotton bag alternatives:

**Cotton bags are cost-effective -** Single-use plastic bags now cost money to buy from the store. Indeed, many governments are imposing a plastic tax to charge for their usage. Shop cotton bags from [Daily Home Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/17894849011?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=DAILY%20HOME%20ESSENTIALS&amp;ref_=bl_dp_s_web_17894849011) as they are built to be affordable.

**Support the environment –** We’ve all got that plastic bag stash in our cupboard. Ditch the plastic stash in place for a few reusable eco-friendly bags and save yourself and the planet. Eco-friendly bags are a clear winner over their weak plastic counterparts. 

**Plastic bags are flimsy -** Plastic bags are prone to break. They’re thin, weak, and not designed for heavy loads, whereas Daily Home Essentials’ eco-friendly produce bags, laundry bags, and tote bags are usually designed to last a long time.

**Cotton bags are durable -** Cotton bags can carry much more weight than a plastic bag can and can be used and reused without losing its performance.

**Stylish** – Cotton bags can be very stylish, making them a popular choice for eco-minded people and companies. Get creative and these eco bags can be personalized to create your own style too! 

Eco-friendly bags are a great way to show your support for the environment. There are a wide variety of reusable bags for all your everyday uses. Going forward, a focus on using eco-friendly products will lead to a greener planet. The advantages of using eco-friendly bags over plastic bags are endless.

There are a lot of things about living in an RV that immediately put one's consumption into perspective and I'm learning a lot about what I need and don't need and how to reduce even further.

It's surprising to me the stereotypes toward people with pickups as being ignorant, self obsessed a-holes. I've even received comments in person.

Hey, I wish my Honda Fit or plug-in Prius before that could tow my home. I really do.

Truth is, my overall impact while living in this 150 square feet is much less than living in my prior full house and driving a subcompact. I used to look green on the street and not so much at home, and now it's the opposite!

I just wish people wouldn't judge without knowing facts, and I wish even more for renewable energy vehicles so there could be less guilt and less shaming for driving larger more powerful vehicles.

However, after a while I would need to buy a new whiteboard pen and these can't be that good for the environment with the plastic exterior and the chemicals. I currently mostly uses mechanical pencils (which I plan on refilling), so would swapping be a wise idea? and can you guys give me a further insight into the environmental impact on whiteboard pens, as I know very little about the topic?

1978,Suggestions on 'showering' after a cycle commute with limited access to water.,"Hello, this is my fist post, not sure if it's in the right place but I'm looking for a more eco friendly way of cleaning myself after a longish commute on a bike.

I currently use a product by muc-off called dry shower. The idea is you squirt a few handfuls and rub it onto your skin and wipe off with a towel. It's supposed to kill bacteria and get rid of sweat. It does quite a good job but I'm looking for a more I guess home made / plastic free alternative.

I don't have access to a shower or a sink in my changing room :-(

Any suggestions would be great!
